Full stack assessment for Meta-Carbon.

Thank you so much for this opportunity, I had to learn js, react
next.js and then strapi in the course of 2 days to even do my best
on this project the final day. I had everything working on both ends individually
and even coded the site using ONLY next.js, my issue was finding how to link the 2 together,
even with simple fetch requests, my final error was being unable to render the pages. I hope you
will still consider me for this position. Thank you again!
